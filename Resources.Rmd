## R Markdown <- start here Mia

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#this is a designated R code chunk; note the r in the {} above. 
#anything that starts with a "#" in an R code chunk is automatically commented out, so it won't run
#this is a great way to annotate code in a Markdown script and in a regular R script
```

## Another header: Resources
We'll use R scripts for writing and executing code
Markdown scripts are great for sharing text AND for coding in other languages (e.g., Python, HTML, CSS etc)

Notice that the README is a markdown script! (.md)

Here are some resources to start you off:

[W3 Schools, super basic tutorials that are fun and easy to follow](https://www.w3schools.com/r/)

[Theresa's googledoc with links to great resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hUaPzIDbcdS27VGzl0bz2uQOLrU-Q7L5F_CMXgs6AOE/edit)

[Swirl, in-house RStudio tutorials](https://swirlstats.com/students.html)

The main things I think you should start to get comfortable with are:

Understanding R's nuances (i.e., we'll be using Tidyverse syntax, but you still need to learn some of the basics)

Importing and "reading" data
Naming and calling objects
Render plots (using "grammar graphics" aka ggplot2)

## Continued learning
We can continue to flush out this document as we work through the basics of R
Don't be afraid to search for help! *A lot* of my learning came from reading comments on Stack Overflow and other online forums
